        <Paragraph>
        Rain was mostly written at the quiet day that was one of the lent events in 2015.
        That day we explored one of the bible readings where Jesus calmed the storm.
        This got me thinking about water, and the different symbolic meanings it can have.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        In verse 1, the first 4 lines use the idea of flowing water. Our thoughts and actions
        form a river which naturally wants to carry you along its well-worn course.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        The last 2 lines of the verse are my favourite part of the song.
        </Paragraph>
        <BlockQuote>
          "Wash away the castles we make, Giving life, giving love".
        </BlockQuote>
        <Paragraph>
        This has several different meanings to me, and has developed a few more since I wrote it.
        I guess the main meaning relates to the parable of the rich fool (Luke 12:13-21). Storing
        up wealth is something our culture do quite well, both in terms of possessions, and in
        terms of social needs. We become members of communities where we feel safe and comfortable.
        Like we've built ourselves a social mansion, with everything we could ever want, to the
        point where we remove any need to leave the house. The problem is, Jesus calls us to
        connect with the outcast, and they're not in our social mansion.
        Sometimes we need to pull down our mansions so that we can build new relationships of
        life and love with those outside.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        I find that the older I get, the less and less I need to deal with change. When I was
        young, things changed often. Different subjects at school each term, students arriving
        and leaving each year, trying out different things, sports, music, hobbies. Life was
        constantly changing. Now days changes are much less frequent. I've been in the same job
        for 11 years, same church for as long, and although it's had some restructuring I have
        many of the same friends. All in all my life is pretty comfortable, which is great, but
        troubling at the same time. Someone once told me
        </Paragraph>
        <BlockQuote>
          "If you're a Christian, and you're comfortable, then you're not doing it right".
        </BlockQuote>
        <Paragraph>
        I don't entirely agree, but I take the point that much of what Jesus calls us to do is
        not comfortable. Visiting sick and imprisoned, helping the homeless, standing up
        against injustice.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        Speaking of injustice, that brings me to the latest meaning those last two lines of
        the verse have had for me. Substitute "castles" with "border protection policies".
        This meaning came to me when I was hearing about the things Lucas has been doing with
        the "Love Makes A Way" group and their non-violent direct actions. It has added a whole
        new dimension to the song for me.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        Looking at the chorus.
        </Paragraph>
        <BlockQuote>
          "After the rain falls down, I might swim or I might drown".
        </BlockQuote>
        <Paragraph>
        This reminds me of the story of Jesus walking on the water, where he calls out to Peter
        to walk out with him. Peter is willing to give it a go even though he doesn't have the
        faith he needs to achieve it. He starts to drown, but then Jesus reaches out and helps
        him. I think we can all have similar experiences when we try something new. We don't
        know if it's going to work or not, but we are willing to give it a go.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
        Looking at the 2nd Verse, this verse talks about the life giving nature of rain.
        Growing up on a farm I was all too aware of the need for rain for plants to grow.
        A farmer's livelihood relies on the variations in the weather. You need times of rain,
        and you need times of Sun. But even though we know this, sometimes we still find rain
        inconvenient and make statements like "I hope it doesn't rain on the weekend".
        A fact of life is that sometimes things are going to annoy us, but if we can get through
        that then we might find that it allowed something new to grow.

        <Paragraph>
          As part of the Lenten Reflection Oasis held on the 22nd of March I ran a music and
          song writing space where people could come and explore their creative side. The aim of the
          activities on the day was to give us time to step out of the business of life for a few
          hours and give us a chance to reflect and explore.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          ‘The Great I AM Is Here’ emerged out of a compilation of smaller sections of lyrics
          (typically 2 or 4 lines) contributed by many different people. The names in the sheet music
          are those people who indicated they would like their name included.
        </Paragraph>

          A brief comment about the inspiration behind the lyrics:
        </Paragraph>
        <Indent>
          <Paragraph>
            Some time ago I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiH9dbAsAp0">this video</a>.
            It is a song that was created after Scott Adams (the creator of dilbert) asked the readers of his blog
            to each submit 2 lines of lyrics which are gibberish, but sound like they might almost make sense.
            I was taken with this idea. Not the gibberish part, but the idea of creating a song from random lyrics
            supplied by many different people. So I thought I'd try it out, and it worked quite well in the end.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Here are the guidelines I supplied:
            <Indent>
              1. Write no more than two lines.<br />
              2. Your lines should be grammatically correct.<br />
              3. It should sound like it might have deep meaning to someone else.<br />
              4. Avoid clunky sounding words. Velvet is good. Cholesterol is bad.<br />
              5. Specify whether your lines are a hook or just part of the regular lyrics.<br />
              6. Draw inspiration from the things you have heard and seen today.<br />
              Could be clever, could be obscure.
            </Indent>
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Inspiration was taken from
            the story telling time at the start of the day, as well as from the other thought provoking
            and reflective activities on the day.
            The words ‘I am here’ were repeated at the start of the day to help people immerse themselves
            fully in the day.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            There was also a story was about Abram (Abraham) and Sari (Sarah) and their journeys.
            As they travelled, they built alters to God in recognition that no matter where they went,
            God was there, ‘I AM is here’. The story time also spoke of how there are times when we step
            out into the unknown, or into the desert, and at times like this we can rely on God to be there
            to guide us.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            In the lyrics, the two similar phrases ‘I am here’ and ‘I AM is here’ came together to create
            a song which talks about God being present, but also that we are also present with God.

grab some breakfast and go about my day.
There's a song in my heart, but I'm only at the start,
Hoping that it's go'n to stay that way.

Yesterday I got into some trouble.
I got into a heated argument.

An accident, someone ran off the road.

If I'm down in the dumps, I can turn to him at once.
