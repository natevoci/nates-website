   With the COVID situation we have not been worshipping on site this year since March, and instead\r\n        we're <a href=\"http://manninghamuc.org/online/\">worshipping online</a>. to contribute

This involves the individuals recording their parts in\r\n        their homes and then mixing it all together.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        During that time we have recorded nearly a dozen of my songs, and I have now uploaded them to youtube and\r\n        added them to the <a href=\"/music/songs.rails\">songs / downloads</a> page.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        You're free to use any of these in your own worship.

You can download the\r\n        music and a live recording from church from the <a href=\"/music/songs.rails\">songs / downloads</a> page.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Audio srcList={[audioRainLive]} />\r\n        <aside>\r\n        You can check out my other music on the <a href=\"/music/songs.rails\">songs&nbsp;/&nbsp;downloads</a> page.\r\n        </aside>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        Rain was mostly written at the quiet day that was one of the lent events.\r\n        That day we explored one of the bible readings where Jesus calmed the storm.\r\n        This got me thinking about water, and the different symbolic meanings it can have.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        In verse 1, the first 4 lines use the idea of flowing water. Our thoughts and actions\r\n        form a river which naturally wants to carry you along its well-worn course.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        The last 2 lines of the verse are my favourite part of the song.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <BlockQuote>\r\n          \"Wash away the castles we make, Giving life, giving love\".\r\n        </BlockQuote>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        This has several different meanings to me, and has developed a few more since I wrote it.\r\n        I guess the main meaning relates to the parable of the rich fool (Luke 12:13-21). Storing\r\n        up wealth is something our culture do quite well, both in terms of possessions, and in\r\n        terms of social needs. We become members of communities where we feel safe and comfortable.\r\n        Like we've built ourselves a social mansion, with everything we could ever want, to the\r\n        point where we remove any need to leave the house. The problem is, Jesus calls us to\r\n        connect with the outcast, and they're not in our social mansion.\r\n        Sometimes we need to pull down our mansions so that we can build new relationships of\r\n        life and love with those outside.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        I find that the older I get, the less and less I need to deal with change. When I was\r\n        young, things changed often. Different subjects at school each term, students arriving\r\n        and leaving each year, trying out different things, sports, music, hobbies. Life was\r\n        constantly changing. Now days changes are much less frequent. I've been in the same job\r\n        for 11 years, same church for as long, and although it's had some restructuring I have\r\n        many of the same friends. All in all my life is pretty comfortable, which is great, but\r\n        troubling at the same time. Someone once told me\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <BlockQuote>\r\n          \"If you're a Christian, and you're comfortable, then you're not doing it right\".\r\n        </BlockQuote>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        I don't entirely agree, but I take the point that much of what Jesus calls us to do is\r\n        not comfortable. Visiting sick and imprisoned, helping the homeless, standing up\r\n        against injustice.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        Speaking of injustice, that brings me to the latest meaning those last two lines of\r\n        the verse have had for me. Substitute \"castles\" with \"border protection policies\".\r\n        This meaning came to me when I was hearing about the things Lucas has been doing with\r\n        the \"Love Makes A Way\" group and their non-violent direct actions. It has added a whole\r\n        new dimension to the song for me.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        Looking at the chorus.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <BlockQuote>\r\n          \"After the rain falls down, I might swim or I might drown\".\r\n        </BlockQuote>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        This reminds me of the story of Jesus walking on the water, where he calls out to Peter\r\n        to walk out with him. Peter is willing to give it a go even though he doesn't have the\r\n        faith he needs to achieve it. He starts to drown, but then Jesus reaches out and helps\r\n        him. I think we can all have similar experiences when we try something new. We don't\r\n        know if it's going to work or not, but we are willing to give it a go.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n        Looking at the 2nd Verse, this verse talks about the life giving nature of rain.\r\n        Growing up on a farm I was all too aware of the need for rain for plants to grow.\r\n        A farmer's livelihood relies on the variations in the weather. You need times of rain,\r\n        and you need times of Sun. But even though we know this, sometimes we still find rain\r\n        inconvenient and make statements like \"I hope it doesn't rain on the weekend\".\r\n        A fact of life is that sometimes things are going to annoy us, but if we can get through\r\n        that then we might find that it allowed something new to grow.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n      </CardItem>\r\n\r\n      <CardItem title=\"New version of TSFileSource\" date=\"22-Apr-2012\">\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          I've uploaded <a href=\"/dev/tsfilesource.rails\">TSFileSource 2.2.1.172</a>.

I'll leave PS mpeg files (2048 byte packets) for later.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n      </CardItem>\r\n\r\n      <CardItem title=\"TSNowAndNext - using Now and Next data to create a ProjectX cut file\" date=\"07-Nov-2011\">\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          While experimenting with Comskip I discovered that the large pre and post padding i\r\n          use with my recordings so that I don't miss stuff when the networks run late was\r\n          causing a lot of unnecessary processing.

We've been discussing mountain top\r\n          experiences, and journeying in church the last few weeks, and then last Friday night\r\n          the universe conspired to give me the motivation to write about it.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          We went to see Hannah Montana The Movie on Friday. Apparently you're supposed to be\r\n          a teenaged girl to go and see that movie, so I got some interesting reactions from people\r\n          when I told them that's what I was going to see.<br />\r\n          Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie. It is disney, so there's the typical feel good\r\n          messages coming through, and I expected that. What I really liked though was the music.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          My only real previous experience of Miley Cyrus' music was her song 7 things, which isn't\r\n          a bad song, but it's not the type of music I listen to a lot.<br />\r\n          There were some songs of that style in the movie, but what I liked were the other songs\r\n          in the movie. The songs performed by Miley as Miley (and not Hannah) I found to be a bit\r\n          more mainstream pop, verging on country/pop which is becoming more popular (like Taylor Swift).\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          There was also some distinctly country music in the movie performed by Rascal Flatts. Both\r\n          the songs they performed I have had for a number of years, but they did acoustic versions\r\n          of them which gave me a new appreciation of the songs. Especially Bless the Broken Road.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          I just love the way the song feels.<br />\r\n          I think it's probably mostly to do with the harmonies they produce, although it's probably\r\n          a combination of factors, but I wanted to try and see if I could take that feeling and put\r\n          it into a song of my own. Given what we'd been discussing in church recently, and the\r\n          added factor that there is talk (and song) of mountain climbing and journeying in\r\n          the movie, that's the theme I went with, and 24 hours later I had a new song.\r\n          Follow The Signs.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          I've made a recording of the song that you can listen to or download from the \r\n          <a href=\"/music/songs.rails\">songs / downloads</a> page along with the sheet music.<br />\r\n          I think it'll sound really cool with a few extra voices, but recording it was fun, and\r\n          it gives a reasonable idea of how it could sound.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          <Audio srcList={[audioFollowTheSigns]} />\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n      </CardItem>\r\n\r\n      <CardItem title=\"I'll Go (new song)\" date=\"26-Apr-2009\">\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          I've taken inspiration from Lucas' sermons about actively taking control of the direction\r\n          of your life rather than just letting the world pass you by, and also drawing a little\r\n          from our trip to Healesville maze for Merryn's birthday.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          The result?\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          A new song called I'll Go.\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          A recording of the song along with the sheet music can be downloaded from the \r\n          <a href=\"/music/songs.rails\">songs / downloads</a> page.<br />\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          <Audio srcList={[audioIllGo]} />\r\n        </Paragraph>\r\n      </CardItem>\r\n\r\n      <CardItem title=\"Your Kingdom (new song)\" date=\"15-Apr-2008\">\r\n        <Paragraph>\r\n          My first song written on an electric guitar.
